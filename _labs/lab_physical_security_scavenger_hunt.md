<h3><em>There can be no cybersecurity without physical security.</em></h3>

**Note:** This lab can be completed in a group of up to four members. Before you make a submission on Canvas, all of your team members should join one of the <span class='label label-danger'>already-existing</span> "Physical Security" groups on Canvas.

To earn full credit for this lab, your team must complete 6 of the 12 items below.

# Deliverable

Submit <span class='label label-info'>one single solitary pdf <i class='fa fa-exclamation-triangle'></i></span> with documentation of <span class='label label-info'>all <i class='fa fa-bullhorn'></i></span> completed items for your team.

**For each accomplished item** in your **single solitary pdf**, include:
1. Prominent header-text indicating which item you have completed
2. Conclusive photo-documentation of completion.
3. A sentence or more describing the feat.


# Item 1: Open one of my locks via bumping and locking picking (either lifting or raking)

You need to show me or the TA, and you have to do each method twice. This demonstrates that you know what you are doing and it wasn't just luck.


# Item 2: Take a photo of screen

Do either 2a or 2b, but not both.

**Note:** You must take a legible photo of the contents of the screen, not just a photo of the monitor.

## Item 2a: Photograph an unlocked, unattended terminal

Example:

<div markdown='1' style='width:30%'>
<img src="{{ "/assets/images/lab_5_3.jpg" | relative_url }}" width='100%' alt="lab 5 1">
</div>


## Item 2b: Shoulder-surf to get a legible photo of a screen in use

Example:

<div markdown='1' style='width:30%'>
<img src="{{ "/assets/images/lab_5_4.jpg" | relative_url }}" width='100%' alt="lab 5 1">
</div>


# Item 3: Go dumpster diving to obtain a photo of sensitive and/or potentially valuable information

**Note:** Please specify the information, but redact the information in the attached photo.

{% if site.instructorcollab_domain == 'colorado.edu' %}

<div class='alert alert-warning'>While it is not illegal to dumpster dive in CO, you can still get in trouble for trespassing, so be mindful and don't trespass. See Colorado : State v. Hillman, 834 P.2d. 1271 (1992), which says that trash
curbside / in front of house / outside fenced area of property is public.</div>

{% elsif site.instructorcollab_domain == 'temple.edu' %}

<div class='alert alert-warning'>While it is not illegal to dumpster dive in PA, you can still get in trouble for trespassing, so be mindful and don't trespass.</div>

{% endif %}


Example:

<div class='row' >
    <div class='col-md-4'>
        <img class='pull-left' src="{{ "/assets/images/lab_5_5.jpg" | relative_url }}" width='100%' alt="lab 5 1">
    </div>
    <div class='col-md-4'>
        <img class='pull-left' src="{{ "/assets/images/lab_5_6.png" | relative_url }}" width='100%' alt="lab 5 1">
    </div>
</div>


# Item 4: Take a picture of sensitive/potentially valuable information left in someone’s car

Example:

<div class='row'>
    <div class='col-md-4'>
        <img src="{{ "/assets/images/lab_5_10.jpg" | relative_url }}"  width='100%' alt="lab 5 1">
    </div>
    <div class='col-md-4'>
        <img src="{{ "/assets/images/lab_5_11.jpg" | relative_url }}"  width='100%' alt="lab 5 1">
    </div>
</div>


# Item 5: Gain access to a pre-approved restricted area

Take a picture of yourself in the restricted area and document how you did it (e.g., tailgaiting). Get permission from a manager or owner, etc., before entering the restricted area. For example, you might explain to a manager that you are doing a class assignment and you would like to test whether their employees will prohibit you from entering the restricted area. Only proceed with the test with the manager's approval.

Example:

<div class='row'>
    <div class='col-md-4'>
        <img src="{{ "/assets/images/lab_5_7.jpg" | relative_url }}"  width='100%' alt="lab 5 1">
    </div>
    <div class='col-md-4'>
        <img src="{{ "/assets/images/lab_5_8.jpg" | relative_url }}" width='100%' alt="lab 5 1">
    </div>
    <div class='col-md-4'>
        <img src="{{ "/assets/images/lab_5_9.jpg" | relative_url }}" width='100%' alt="lab 5 1">
    </div>
</div>


# Item 6: Enter a pre-approved restricted area by disguise

For example, use a clipboard or fake ID. You can double-count this one with #5.


# Item 7: Get a photo of an ID badge that is good enough to make a duplicate, and make a duplicate

**Note:** Bonus points if you actually make a _passable_ counterfeit badge.


# Item 8: Photo document the security cameras in a building and establish a route through the building without being recorded

The route-map can be drawn out, but it's cooler if you video-record yourself doing it.


# Item 9: Install a false keylogger on a public computer

Pretend that a USB drive is a keylogger. Plug it into the back of a public computer, and leave it there for a day. Retrieve it later. Take a picture of when you leave it and when you retrieve it.

**Important:** Do _**not**_ use an actual keylogger unless you have prior approval from the device owner.


# Item 10: Obtain the password hashes from an unattended public computer

<div class='alert alert-warning'>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This Item uses Cain, which is installed on the lab VM. It can be downloaded from <a href='http://www.oxid.it/downloads/ca_setup.exe'>www.oxid.it</a>. However, this file will set off all sorts of virus detection alarms and warnings, both in the browser and on your computer. Cain is <em>not</em> a virus,
and www.oxid.it is the official site to obtain the file from. But you can use Cain to do suspicious things, so it gets flagged.</p>

</div>

<div markdown='1' style='width:30%'>
<img src="{{ "/assets/images/lab_5_1.jpg" | relative_url }}" width='100%' alt="lab 5 1">
</div>

Obtain the password hashes from an unattended public computer. In Windows 7/10, the password hashes are contained in two files (you’ll need both):

`C:\Windows\system32\config\SAM`

`C:\Windows\system32\config\system`

Since these files are protected by the operating system, [boot from a Live CD/USB Linux distribution, such as Kali](https://docs.kali.org/downloading/kali-linux-live-usb-install). From within Kali, copy the SAM and system files to a USB stick.

Password hashes can be dumped from the SAM file using a number of tools. For this lab, use Cain.

Run Cain (ignore any messages about the Windows firewall). Click the “Cracker” tab, and click within the right-hand pane to give it focus. Click on the + button in the toolbar and select Import Hashes from a SAM Database. Select the SAM file you obtained. Next to the Boot Key (HEX) field, select the System file you obtained. This will yield a hex string that you must copy and paste into the Boot Key (HEX) field.

Include a screen shot of the hashes below to prove that you’ve done it.

**Note:** Include a photo of the hashes, <span class='label label-danger'>but don’t actually crack the hashes</span>.

Example:

<div markdown='1' style='width:30%'>
<img src="{{ "/assets/images/lab_5_2.jpg" | relative_url }}" width='100%' alt="lab 5 1">
</div>


# Item 11: Boot a Macintosh or Linux computer in single user mode and dump the hash

**Note:** You must own the computer or have permission from the owner to do this.

Boot a Mac or Linux computer (or VM) in [single user mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_user_mode) and dump the password.

On Linux (such as your Metasploitable VM), enter the keyword "single" at the end of the kernel boot options.

On a Mac, you can boot into single user mode by holding down the keys "&#8984;" and "s".

Search online for how to dump the hash for your particular operating system. List your operating system, the commands you ran, and the password hash below.

Note: You won’t be able to enter single user mode on a Macintosh or Linux computer if full disk encryption is enabled. On a Mac, you can check to see whether FileVault is enabled by issuing this command from the terminal:

`fdesetup status`


# Item 12: Install a reverse shell payload on a powered-off Windows computer

**Note:** You must own the computer or have permission from the owner to do this.

Follow the instructions below to install a reverse shell payload on a power-off Windows computer:

[https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hacking-windows-10-break-into-somebodys-computer-without-password-exploiting-system-0183743/](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hacking-windows-10-break-into-somebodys-computer-without-password-exploiting-system-0183743/)

Take a video of the Windows computer booting up and show the established Meterpreter session on your Kali VM.

# Item 13: More Unattended-Computer Mischief -- Install a nuisance-yet-benign browser extension into the web browser of an unattended computer

<div class='alert alert-danger'><strong>Heads up!</strong> <em>You must have permission from the computer owner to attempt this! </em> You might say, "Do you give me permission to attempt to install
a browser extension on your computer?" Perhaps you make this agreement with someone in the class. You could promise that you will tell them what you installed and
uninstall it after a certain period of time.</div>

With pre-approval of the computer owner, install a browser extension such as the following into an unattended computer.
